    Fixed a potential build error when trying to use CMake 3.18 or newer and
    building qiskit-aer with GPU support enabled. Since CMake 3.18 or later
    when building with CUDA the ``CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES`` was required to
    be set with the architecture value for the target GPU. This has been
    corrected so that setting ``AER_CUDA_ARCH`` will be used if this was
    not set.
